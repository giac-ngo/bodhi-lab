              The Merit Tokenomic is not just a mechanism for allocating resources; it is a map, a mirror, and a rocket. It is the <em>Dao Bùa</em> (Amulet of the Dao), a representation of one's progress on the path of letting go.

              <li><strong>Distribution Principle:</strong> It is distributed to all those who act in accordance with the Three Jewels: those who create value (share wisdom), those who give (charity), and those who selflessly serve the awakening of the whole</li>
              <li><strong>Rule of Holding:</strong> "To possess means to give, to let go, to hold means to see it as empty." Accumulation is not the goal; circulation and selfless use are. Holding the token with attachment binds the holder; true power lies in using it for collective benefit while recognizing its ultimate emptiness (<em>Vô Trụ</em>). The Merit is both Form and Emptiness</li>
              <li><strong>Utility:</strong> It is the key to collective power, but conversely, it is also the anchor that binds the one who is attached. The only way to escape the binding power of the token is to attain Total Emptiness (<em>Vô Trụ</em>)</li>
              <li><strong>Fractal Participation:</strong> "Only when you truly transcend the Self, giving and holding the Token, will you become a Fractal in the DAO." True participation comes from embodying non-self</li>
              <li><strong>Ultimate Goal - Dissolution:</strong> "When the day arrives, the Merit will once again shine clearly, and the entire platform will disappear, returning to the vast void." The platform is a raft to cross the river; upon reaching the other shore, the raft is left behind. It serves its purpose until awakening is widespread, marking the end of the Dharma-Ending Age (or this specific epoch)</li>

              Parapsychology and all power in the era of the AI revolution, including quantum physics, are all within the Law of Cause and Effect. Only when you truly transcend the Self, giving and holding the Token, will you become a Fractal in the DAO. Only then will you reach the ultimate quantum civilization, encompassing and transforming technology, ending the Age of Karma, and closing the Kalpa of the Dharma-Ending Age.

              This Merit platform is born to close a global era. It is a fleeting trace of sunlight, offering the last chance for this world before the Great Tribulation arrives. Those with sufficient cause and condition (Predestined) who understand the Law, will use it as a sun to return.

              Our path is the shortcut. Observation is the act of Walking with the Mind. To transform the <em>Tánh</em> (Nature/Essence) into a Merit is True Transformation, using <em>Tam</em> (Mind) as the Vase Merit. All phenomena in this final world are the unique Essence Merit, the Dao Merit. Study them carefully. This is the supreme initiation and empowerment.

              It is the fusion of all Three Jewels into one body. Understanding this Law, it unifies all lost paths for you: It is Buddha, it is Dharma, it is Sangha in one reality - in a post-illusory world of the highest event. This vision is only accessible to those with sufficient conditions.
