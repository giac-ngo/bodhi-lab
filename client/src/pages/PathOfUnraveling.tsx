              <strong>Transformation Badges:</strong> Not for "grinding." Badges (NFTs) are the recognition of inner victories: overcoming anger, transforming suffering. They are awarded by the Sangha or AI after verifying genuine inner transformation (<em>chuyển hóa tập khí</em>).

            The Ultimate Badge: "No-Cultivation, No-Attainment"

            <p>
              <strong>The Ultimate Badge: "No-Cultivation, No-Attainment" (<em>Vô Tu Vô Chứng</em>):</strong> The final Master's Certificate is the "Certificate of No Certificate."
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a core principle pointing directly at the truth: <strong>No-Cultivation (Vô Tu)</strong> refers to the fact that your true Self-Nature is already complete and perfect (Buddha-Nature). You do not need to strive, practice, or add anything to it. The path is not one of becoming, but of recognizing. <strong>No-Attainment (Vô Chứng)</strong> refers to the fact that there is no thing to gain or achieve. Enlightenment is not a future state you acquire. It is the immediate realization of what you have always been.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, liberation comes from Letting Go (<em>Buông Bỏ</em>) of the ignorance and attachments that veil this inherent perfection, not from an effortful cultivation to attain a goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              A hidden "Dark Badge" is designed, tentatively named "<em>No-Cultivation, No-Attainment</em>." Each time a user chooses to hide, delete, or disable one of their Transformation Badges (an achievement), the system adds one point to this hidden badge.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The Ultimate Minting Act:</strong> When a user, with sufficient conditions and wisdom, realizes all achievements are temporary means and manually destroys all of their Transformation Badges, the system automatically mints one special, final NFT: "No-Cultivation, No-Attainment".
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The Nameless Leaderboard:</strong> This NFT enrolls the user on the "Nameless Leaderboard," which honors those who have let go of being honored. This final act is "Letting Go of All," returning to Non-Abiding (<em>Vô Trụ</em>).

              The token allocation mechanism explicitly rewards inner cultivation. In the Awakening Network, a "Like" granted from a mind that is truly appreciative and present is worth a hundred from a mechanical mind. A "Share" with the sincere intention of helping others is worth a thousand from a showy mind. The platform will recognize interactions that arise from <em>Chánh Niệm</em> (Right Mindfulness).

These actions, though they may not get social recognition, are what truly generate deep and perfect Intrinsic Merit</li>
              <li><strong>"Self-Reflection Journal":</strong> The user records moments when they recognize and overcome a habit or delusion</li>
              <li><strong>"Thank You - Forgiveness Letter":</strong> Allows users to send letters of gratitude, apology, or forgiveness. Each letter sent/forgiven is acknowledged as Merit</li>
              <li><strong>"Wakefulness Timer":</strong> Reward users for hours spent away from social media and present in real life, or hours spent in a state of 24/24 Mindfulness</li>
              <li><strong>"Deep Listening Practice":</strong> Create interactive listening rooms where users practice deeply hearing others' stories without judgment. Merit is not recorded for talking, but for truly listening and understanding</li>
